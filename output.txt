Adding Slack variables, since type 2

The standard form is:
A = 
	1	-1	1	0	
	1	1	0	1	
	
b = 
	2	
	6	
	
C = 
	1	
	-1	
	0	
	0	
	
Phase I not required.

Our original BFS is X1 = 0, X2 = 0, 

Phase II started.

Phase II Iteration 1

Current X:
X1 = 0, X2 = 6, Current Z = 1


Optimal Solution Reached.
Optimal X:
X1 = 0, X2 = 6, Maximum Z = 1


For Constraint 1:
LHS = -6.000000 <= 2.000000 = b(1), Correct.

For Constraint 2:
LHS = 6.000000 <= 6.000000 = b(2), Correct.

The solution is feasible (all Xi >=0)
